About
=====
The goal of this project was to encourage energy efficiency changes throughout the Chicago area by providing a tool that is informative, educational, and encourages action. The tool is based on a one-of-a-kind dataset that aggregates all of the energy data (gas & electric) from 2010 at the census block level. For a copy of the raw data, look here: ENTER LINK
